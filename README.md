# Search Engine Spam Blocklist
A regularly maintained blocklist to filter out spam and junk domains from search engines results.


## What's this about?
You know all those weird autogenerated spammy sites that always pop up in search results, with such amazing titles as "FREE prize sex hot stud bangs busty Finnish Healthcare Clinics for sale"?

This list aims to collect as many of them as possible, by searching for specific word combinations found almost solely on this kind of sites.
It's mainly thought to be used with search results filtering tools such as Search Engine Spam Blocker (developed by the same people behind this list and available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-engine-spam-blocker)), Google Hit Hider or uBlacklist.

## Notes
- Despite our best efforts to keep it updated and tidy, this list may contain false positives. If you notice one, please let us know by opening an issue.
