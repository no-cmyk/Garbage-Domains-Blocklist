# Search Engine Spam Domains Blocklist
A regularly maintained blocklist to filter out spam domains from search engines' results.


## What's this about?
You know all those weird autogenerated spammy sites that always pop up in search results, with such amazing titles as "FREE prize sex hot stud bangs busty Finnish Healthcare Clinics for sale"?

This list aims to collect as many of them as possible, and is compiled by searching for specific word combinations that appear almost solely on spam domains.

This list is mainly thought to be used in conjunction with search result filtering extensions like Google Hit Hider or uBlacklist.

## Instructions
1. Open [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Domains-Blocklist/master/blocklist.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Domains-Blocklist/master/blocklist.txt);
2. Copy and paste it into your favourite search result filtering extension.

## Notes
- Despite my best efforts to keep it updated and tidy, this list may contain false positives. If you notice a false positive, please report it with a new issue.
- Because of the size of this list it may take a bit to load and/or serve its function, depending on the inner workings of the extension it's been fed into.
