# Search Engine Spam Domains Blocklist
A regularly maintained blocklist to filter out spam domains from search engines' results.


## What's this about?
You know all those weird autogenerated spammy sites that always pop up in search results, with such amazing titles as "FREE prize sex hot stud bangs busty Finnish Healthcare Clinics for sale"?

This list aims to collect as many of them as possible, and is compiled by searching for specific word combinations that appear almost solely on spam domains. It's mainly thought as a tool to be used in pair with search result filtering extensions like Google Hit Hider or uBlacklist.

## Instructions
1. Open [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Domains-Blocklist/master/blocklist.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Domains-Blocklist/master/blocklist.txt)
2. Copy and paste it into your favourite search result filtering extension.

## Notes
- Despite my best efforts to keep it updated and tidy, this list may contain false positives. If you notice a false positive, please let me know by opening a new issue.
- Because of the sheer size of this list, it may take a while to load and/or serve its function depending on the inner workings of the extension it's used with. For this reason a lighter version of the list is available, which you can find here: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Domains-Blocklist/master/blocklist_light.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Domains-Blocklist/master/blocklist_light.txt);
this version doesn't contain sites registered under .tk, .gq, .ga, .ml and .cf domains.
